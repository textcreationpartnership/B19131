            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And We doe therefore straightly Charge and Command all Our loving Subjects whatsoever, upon their Allegiance, not to obey any of the said Warrants, or any other Warrants of the like nature granted or issued without Our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Consent, and such as by colour of such Authority have assembled together, that they immediately disband and repaire to their houses. And We doe once more renew Our offer of a free and gratious Pardon to all Our Subjects of Our said three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Counties, excepting those whom We before excepted in Our severall Proclamations concerning those Our Counties, and excepting Sir <hi>Edward Bainton,</hi> who hath exercised such cruell traiterous and unheard of Insolencies over his fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as cannot be paralelled, against all which We shall proceed according to the Rules of the Law, as against Persons guilty of high Treason. And whom We doe hereby require all Our Officers and Ministers of Iustice, and all Our loving Subjects what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, to apprehend and cause to be kept in safe Custody. And Our Expresse Pleasure is, and We doe hereby will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all the severall Tenants of the Persons excepted in Our Proclamation, for those three Counties of <hi>Glocester, Somerset,</hi> and <hi>Wilts,</hi> and all other persons who are any wayes indebted unto them, and all the Tenants to any other person of any of the said Counties, who is now in Actuall and open Rebellion against Vs, or who after the publishing of this Our Proclamation shall contribute to the maintenance of the Armies now in Rebellion against Vs, under the Conduct of <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> the said Earle of <hi>Stanford,</hi> or of any other Person or persons, That they forbeare to pay any Rents or Debts due to the said severall Persons, but deteine the same in their hands towards the maintenance of the Peace of the Counties, and the reparation of such men who have suffered by the violence of the others. And if any Souldier or Souldiers now under Command against Vs, in either of Our said three Counties, shall within sixe dayes after the publishing of this Proclamation, apprehend and bring before Vs or any Officers of Our Army, or any other Our Minister of Iustice, so that the Person apprehended be kept in safe Custody, the bodies of any of the Persons so excepted by Vs, or of any of the Commanders or Officers now in Rebellion against Vs in any of the said three Counties, such Souldier or Souldiers, besides their Pardons, shall receive such liberall Rewards by Pensions or otherwise, as their severall Services in respect of the qualities of the Persons so apprehended shall deserve. And if any Commander or Officer (except the Persons before excepted) now in Rebellion against Vs in any of the said three Counties, shall within five dayes after this Our Proclamation published, being convinced in his Conscience of his damnable offence against God and Vs, in assisting this odious Rebellion, returne to His Allegiance, and repaire to Our Army, and commit no hostile Act in the meane while against Vs, We shall not only Pardon him, but so farre imploy him as his quality and demeanour shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve. And We doe hereby require all Our Loving Subjects of what degree or quality soever, within Our said three severall Counties, upon their Allegiance, and as they tender the cause of God, the Protestant Religion, being invaded and threatned to be rooted up by Anabaptists, Brownists, and Atheists, of Vs, and Our Posterity, (Our Life being sought after by this Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of themselves the Law and Liberty of the Subject being in apparant hazard to be subjected to an Arbitrary Lawlesse power, of a few Schismaticall, Factious and ambitious Persons) to assist Us in Person, or with the Loane of Money, Plate, and Horses, in this Our great necessity. And having said thus much out of Our tender regard of Our Subjects of those Our Counties; If they shall henceforward be guilty of the premisses, and shall either by Loane or Contribution assist the said Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Rebells, assemble and Muster themselves in Armes without Authority derived from Vs under Our Hand, or shall enter into any Oath of Association for opposing Vs and Our Army, and so compell Vs to send part of Our Forces thither, to reduce them to their Obedience, they must answer the miseries, that must follow, to God, and their Countrey. And Our Pleasure is, That this Our Proclamation be read in all the Parish Churches and Chappells in the said three severall Counties.</p>
